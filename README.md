## Inline elements

It supports most inline decorations that [gfm](https://github.github.com/gfm) supports, and has a few more.

### Underlines

`~_Underlines_~` is rendered to ~_Underlines_~. Underlines may not contain any newline. The first and the last character may not be space.

## Macros

HMD doesn't let you use raw html tags. Instead, it has plenty of macros.

Some macros have opening and closing elements, just like HTML tags! Those macros are translated directly to HTML tags. For them to be translated correctly, they should not mess up with `<p>` tags. So an opening macro and closing one should be in the same paragraph, or take up a single paragraph. See examples below.

```
[[red]]

This text is red!

[[/red]]

[[red]] This text is red! [[/red]]
```

> Properly closed.

```
[[red]] This text is not red!

Because the closing macro is in another paragraph. [[/red]]
```

> Not proper.

### Colors

The actual colors may differ depending on css files you use.

| Name |                      Showcase                      |
|:----:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| Red  | [[red]] This text is red! [[/red]]                 |
| Blue | [[blue]] This text is blue! [[/blue]]              |

## Backslash Escapes

Unlike gfm, backslash escapes work everywhere, even inside code blocks!
